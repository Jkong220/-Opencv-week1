# -Opencv-week1
This weekâ€™s task is about getting comfortable with OpenCV, a library that helps computers work with images and videos. You will explore how to make the computer read pictures, show them on the screen, change them (like turning them black &amp; white, blurring, or finding edges), and even work with live camera feeds.
